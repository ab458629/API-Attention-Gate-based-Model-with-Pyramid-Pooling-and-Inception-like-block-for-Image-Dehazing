# API-Attention-Gate-based-Model-with-Pyramid-Pooling-and-Inception-like-block-for-Image-Dehazing

## Abstract
Itâ€™s hazardous that bad weather condition makes things less clear e.g., haze, fog, heavy rain and snow; to ensure safety in haze, the proposed model, a Deep Learning based method for single image dehazing, contains the Inception-like block, Pyramid Pooling block, and Attention Gate mechanism to enlarge SSIM (Structural similarity) and PSNR (Peak signal-to-noise ratio) to get clear image. Finally, I show the experimental result of image dehazing and compare quantitative analysis with other state-of-the-art methods to prove my dehazing alogrithm could be real-time.

## Methodology
The Inception-like block and Pyramid Pooling block use varying kernel size 
in parallel to extract different scale features of images in order to enlarge 
receptive field. Attention Gate is a successful method of image segmentation 
in medical field. Therefore, I noticed that the haze image losing target 
structures needs to highlight salient features.
